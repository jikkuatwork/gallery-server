## Features

3. Theme togglable between light and dark.
4. Videos also supported!
5. More than one galleries can be served at the same time.
6. A lot of gallery features. Check it at [react-images](https://jossmac.github.io/react-images/#/accessibility).

## FAQ

1. Q: Why `403 forbidden`Ôºü

   ```json
   {
     "code": 403,
     "message": "Forbidden. `token` required. Please redirect to https://github.com/legend80s/gallery-server#faq for more information."
   }
   ```

   - A: Add token to the resource url if you are the gallery owner otherwise ask the owner for the token.

2. Photos in node_modules will be ignored for the performance.

## Develop

Install all the dependencies into `./package.json`'s devDependencies not `./client/package.json`. The package.json in `client` exits only for `scripts`„ÄÇ

For example if you want change to another gallery:

```sh
# enter project root not ./client/
cd project_root

npm install --save-dev react-bnb-gallery

# start api server
npm run start:server

# start webpack devServer
npm run start:client

# finish coding, run this cmd to build
npm run start -- --folder /path/to/images
```

## Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```
